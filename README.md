## Overview

This repository contains my full solution to the Extra Assignment for Math 467.  
The project involves simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and using the Feynman–Kac formula to numerically solve a partial differential equation (PDE).

All simulations and plots were implemented in Python and presented using a Jupyter Notebook.
